# Banana News
News website including news, games, politics and tech reviews


## ðŸŽ‰Banana News has been updated. The new features:ðŸŽ‰
- clicking on image to enlarge on news page
- easy READ MORE integration
- new search logic that filters through the text in pages to get a more accurate search.

You should try testing the search bar and tell me if there are any errors
(I also added a no results found and loading animation for the search results page)


## I don't know why the page isn't showing language percentages but here is an approximation:
1. HTML: 58%
2. JS: 30%
3. CSS: 12%

## Views:
very approximately at least over 300 views to our website since it was put up. There has been 21 views to the site on May 19 (I know that sounds like a lot for one day but that's just me checking the website when I was working on it and in reality there have been many days with 0 views). We are now getting an accurate view count starting from 18 may.
