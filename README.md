# Banana News
News website including news, games, politics and tech reviews


## ðŸŽ‰Banana News has been updated. The new features:ðŸŽ‰
- clicking on image to enlarge on news page
- easy READ MORE integration
- new search logic that filters through the text in pages to get a more accurate search.

You should try testing the search bar and tell me if there are any errors
(I also added a no results found and loading animation for the search results page)


## I don't know why the page isn't showing language percentages but here is an approximation:
1. HTML: 58%
2. JS: 30%
3. CSS: 12%

## Views:
There have been over 2000 views from 10 countries since I started tracking so at least 3000 views to the site since when it was put up on Feb 17.
