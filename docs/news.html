<h2>Jetblue:</h2>
<p>Jetblue offers a fully reclining seat and the largest TV and bed space of any US airline. With their new Mint business class, a fully enclosed suite with lie flat beds and a large television are offered along with large overhead bins, mood lighting and a high quality mattress, all for a good price for business class.</p>

<h2>China Eastern:</h2>
<p>China eastern has an even better value business class, with reclining seat, meal service, privacy doors and other features in their suite but the best part is the price. China eastern is a cheap airline and offers such a good value business class compared to the hugely expensive business from other airlines.</p>

            <div data-index="15" class="hidden"><p> some going so far as to replace their Airbus A318s and Airbus A319s with the new A220. Yes, it has proved to be more popular than the A318neo and A319neo. But the airlines are not satisfied. They like the fuel efficiency and modern technology of the a220 more than the a320neo, (which makes sense since it's just an a320ceo with some sharklets and a new engine). So now it looks like Airbus' new A220 is going to kill their a318 and a319, before possibly moving onto the a320 family. Ironically, the a220 was originally produced by Bombardier as the Bombardier Cseries but was bought by Airbus after Bombardier was rejected by the US and let Airbus do the final production in their US factory. However it came with a great cost because now Airbus 100% owns the family and has renamed it to the A220.</p>

<h2>The Boeing 747 - The aircraft that changed the world for the better</h2>
<p><br>Ever since the first flight of the Boeing 747-100 in 1969, over 55 years ago...</p>
<button data-index="14">READ MORE</button>
<div data-index="14" class="hidden"><p> it still soars in the skies as one of the most influential aircraft in history.<br><img class="sFlh5c ag2Pqd pT0Scc" style="margin:0px;max-width:1024px;position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQauGwpJMSryixL0RwFt6rtw7sUdfQKNGgB0w&amp;s" alt="N747PA - Wikipedia" height="411" jsaction="VQAsE" jsname="JuXqh" data-ilt="1718177713936"></p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:35.34%;"><img class="sFlh5c pT0Scc iPVvYb image_resized" style="aspect-ratio:550/411;margin:0px;max-width:1024px;" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Boeing_747-121%28A-SF%29%2C_Pan_American_World_Airways_-_Pan_Am_AN0133908.jpg" alt="N747PA - Wikipedia"  height="411" jsaction="VQAsE" jsname="kn3ccd" aria-hidden="false"></figure>
<p><br>Pan Am (Pan American World Airways) was an airline regarded for its luxury that went bankrupt in 1991 and the launch customer for the aircraft. It was also a huge influence on the development of the aircraft to a scale very scarce today. The introduction of the first wide body jetliner was a huge improvement to air travel - slashing flight ticket costs to make flying a more economical solution for everyone.<br><br>The -200 was very similar to the 747-100 but with a stretched upper deck. The original upper deck was just a strange space behind the cockpit, only created for allowing it to function well as a cargo aircraft, but airlines soon started making use of the space. Some of the most noticeable were Qantas’ Captain Cook Lounge, American Airlines’ upper deck piano bar and Pan Am’s onboard restaurant that included a full menu and proper restaurant tables.<br><br>The 747-300 was another advancement to the aircraft, with the upper deck stretched again and more improvements made.<br><br>The -400 was the most popular variant and one of the most important because of its use from so many airlines. Pretty much every large airline that was around at the time had operated the 747, because of its amazing specifications in capacity and price for tickets.<br>&nbsp;</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:38.28%;"><img class="sFlh5c pT0Scc iPVvYb" style="aspect-ratio:559/373;margin:0px;max-width:1200px;" src="https://i2.wp.com/insideflyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_1476.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&amp;ssl=1" alt="Air China First Class review: Boeing 747-8 from Beijing to Frankfurt" height="373" jsaction="VQAsE" jsname="kn3ccd" aria-hidden="false"></figure>
<p><br>Lastly, the -8 was the final and largest variant with a stretched upper deck and fuselage, as well as the curved wingtips and many modern technologies that were from the 787 program.<br><br>Sadly, the same reason for its success has proved to be its downfall as these days airlines don’t really want such a high capacity airliner (the same goes with the a380) that takes such a lot of fuel and other costs to operate. It can definitely be said that when Boeing introduced the high tech advanced 787 Dreamliner they basically killed the A380 and their 747 at the same time.<br><br>Nonetheless, after 55 years many airlines some airlines still operate the type, which are Lufthansa, Korean Air, Air China, Saudia and Asiana. (Saudia and Asiana are not even long term airlines operating it as all of their 747-400s will be retired in less than a year). There is still some hope with the others because they operate newer 747-8s which will likely be around for a longer time.<br><br>Lufthansa will still aim to get rid of their 747s, because they are awaiting the Boeing 777x - a huge widebody airliner that will be delivered in 2025 and has attractive capacity and range to totally replace the 747-8. Korean Air also aims to retire the type, while Air China seems satisfied with their 747-8s which they use to fly between Beijing and Shanghai, Frankfurt, Sao Paulo and New York JFK to name a few.</p>

            <button data-index="12">READ MORE</button>
            <div class="hidden" data-index="12"><p> moving into different categories such as price, comfort, fleet size, destinations and service. Then we will determine the best airline in general</p>
            <h3>Category 1: Price</h3>
            <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:30.33%;"><img style="aspect-ratio:2048/1278;" src="https://facts.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/19-facts-about-spirit-airlines-1690008228.jpg" width="2048" height="1278"></figure>
            <p>Spirit, Frontier, Ryanair and Airasia are all extremely cheap airlines. Choosing the cheapest will depend on the route and convenience. If you live in the USA, Frontier or Southwest would probably be the cheapest option, but for flights within Asia, Airasia, Scoot, etc. might be cheapest.</p>
            <h3>Category 2: Comfort</h3>
            <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:35.95%;"><img style="aspect-ratio:1383/719;" src="https://martinroll.com/wp-content/uploads/Singapore-Airlines-%E2%80%93-An-Excellent-Iconic-Asian-Brand-Martin-Roll.jpg" width="1383" height="719"></figure>
            <p><strong>Singapore Airlines.</strong></p>
            <p>Emirates, Etihad, Singapore Airlines and Air France all offer great comfort, but in a general scope I would say <strong>Singapore Airlines</strong> wins out.</p>
            <p>When comparing comfort we obviously don't have to worry about the route, since we are just comparing the general comfort of the airline in first class. While airlines like Emirates offer an onboard bar, with Emirates and Etihad providing showers, Singapore Airlines would win out in general because of their bed quality.</p>
            <h3>Category 3: Reliability and service</h3>
            <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:38.57%;"><img class="sFlh5c pT0Scc iPVvYb" style="aspect-ratio:574/298;margin:0px;max-width:1168px;" src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/cd/52/1d/qatar-airways.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=-1&amp;s=1" alt="Qatar Airways Reviews and Flights (with pictures) - Tripadvisor"height="298" jsaction="VQAsE" jsname="kn3ccd" aria-hidden="false"></figure>
            <p><strong>Qatar Airways.</strong></p>
            <p>Comparing the reliability of airlines, <strong>Qatar Airways </strong>wins out because of their immense customer service and reliability.</p>
            <h3>Category 4: Destinations</h3>
            <figure class="image image_resized" style="width:41.78%;"><img class="sFlh5c pT0Scc iPVvYb" style="aspect-ratio:574/298;margin:0px;max-width:1168px;" src="https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0e/cd/51/76/american-airlines.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=-1&amp;s=1" alt="American Airlines Reviews and Flights (with pictures) - Tripadvisor" height="298" jsaction="VQAsE" jsname="kn3ccd" aria-hidden="false"></figure>
            <p><strong>American Airlines.</strong></p>
            <p>Even though other airlines such as United Airlines, Turkish Airlines and Delta Airlines offer huge amounts of destinations, American Airlines wins out with 350 destinations.</p>

      <p>In case you didn't already know, Spirit is an ultra low cost carrier that is not very comfortable to fly on. After Jetblue's plans to acquire the airline were rejected, Spirit airlines has been struggling to stay alive with huge losses and increased competition from other carriers. After some engine failures discovered, Spirit has had to ground many of their aircraft and has been having trouble pulling in enough revenue. Trying to think of ways to increase revenue, Spirit has made changes to some policies such as increasing the maximum baggage weight allowed to check in.</p>
      
      <p>The conclusion? Spirit is having trouble and may become bankrupt in the next decade.</p>

<h2>Freighter airlines use such old aircraft</h2>
<p>Freighter airlines often seem to use very old aircraft such as...</p>
<button data-index="10">READ MORE</button>
<div class="hidden" data-index="10"><p> A300s, DC10s, MD11s, A310s and 747s. But why are they using these old planes and not more fuel efficient newer aircraft. Freight airlines often get their aircraft at a discount from previous passenger services, acquiring old planes at a very cheap price. They don't need to worry about fuel efficiency to pay of the price they paid because they got it so cheaply. Meanwhile, passenger airlines which are flying their planes on many routes at many times need their aircraft to be fuel efficient, while freighter airlines might only need to fly a couple times a day.</p>
<p>If you don't need to fly many times a day with your aircraft, purchasing a cheap one is a good idea. And cheap aircraft are often old second hand ones from passenger airlines.</p>

<h2>747s over Melbourne become a rare treat</h2>
<p>Boeing 747s were never hugely common around Melbourne, because even when Qantas operated a huge fleet they...</p>
<button data-index="9">READ MORE</button><div class="hidden" data-index="9"><p> would more likely be deployed on long haul international routes and coming to Melbourne would be pretty uncommon.</p>

<p>These days, when only 4-5 airlines (soon to be 3) still operate 747s for passenger service, basically the only chance of seeing a 747 around Melbourne is for cargo. Cathay Pacific Cargo, AtlasAir, UPS, etc. sometimes have flights to Melbourne using 747-8s or very rarely, -400s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Recently, an Atlas Air 747-400 flew over Melbourne, landing at Melbourne Airport and last year a Cathay Pacific Cargo 747-8 flew over. Soon 747s will only be operated for cargo service, and later they won't be there at all. Future presidents may be the last people to fly on the Boeing 747.</p>

<p>Emirates is pushing Boeing to release it but they have announced that it will be delivered in 2025. I am wondering why Emirates also chose the 777x for their fleet, since the A350 is lighter and requires less fuel but I think its probably because of the higher capacity and since its now the biggest commercial aircraft on the market, Emirates wants to purchase it to eventually replace the A380, which has ceased sales.</p>
<p>Even since the first flight was in 2020, it commonly takes 5-7 years before the aircraft is released to the market, and I am excited for the first delivery.</p>
