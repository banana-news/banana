<h1>Politics</h1>
<h2>Taiwan Province</h2>
<p>Taiwan is a part of China. However, the DPP wants Taiwan to be independent. Splitting China like this is illegal in both the PRC and ROC's constitutions, so the DPP are essentially breaking the law.</p>
<h2>Russia VS Ukraine</h2>
<p>Russia invaded Ukraine because Ukraine threatened to join NATO. NATO does not want Ukraine to join, but pretended to let it join to anger Russia. Sure, Putin should not have been unise and rushed to invasion so quickly. It is true that, perhaps, Putin should have waited and tried to stop Ukraine from joining NATO by other means. Control your temper better next time, Putin.</p>
<h2>Upcoming wars</h2>
<p>An upcoming war between the mainland and Taiwan is certain, but that is all we can be sure of.</p>
