<h1>Technology-Latest news</h1>
<h2>Phones</h2>
<h3>Huawei</h3>

<p>Really, the only Huawei phones anyone should buy are the Mate 60 Pro and Mate 60, due to their 5G and good values.</p>

<h3>OnePlus</h3>
<p>For OnePlus, either buy the OnePlus 12R (Known as the Ace 3 in China) or OnePlus 12 for their good specifications and resonable price.</p>
<h3>Realme</h3>
<p>Just forget about Realme.</p>


<h3>Oppo</h3>
<p>Just buy the Find X7 Ultra.</p>


<h3>Vivo</h3>

<p>Forget about Vivo.
</p>
<h3>iQOO</h3>
<p>Only get the iQOO 12 Pro.</p>

<h3>Forget about Apple and Samsung.</h3>

<h2>Tablets</h2>

<p>Only buy iPads.</p>

<h2>Laptops</h2>
<p>Lenovo is obviously the best, but if you want to be boring then you can get a HP laptop. If you want to be cheap, go for a DELL chromebook. (Be warned: Chromebooks are terrible). And only get a Mac if you want to do video editing or like the Apple ecosystem.</p>
