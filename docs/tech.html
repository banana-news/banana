<h1>Technology - Latest news</h1>
<h2>Phones</h2>

<h3>Huawei</h3>

<p>Really, the only Huawei phones anyone should buy are the Mate 60 Pro and Mate 60, due to their 5G and good values.</p>

<img src="oneplus 12.png" alt="The Oneplus 12" height="400px" style="float:left;">
<img src="oneplus 12r.png" alt="The Oneplus 12R" height="400px">
<h3>OnePlus</h3>
<p>For OnePlus, either buy the OnePlus 12R (Known as the Ace 3 in China) or OnePlus 12 for their good specifications and resonable price. Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for the 12R, 8 Gen 3 for the 12, Aqua touch, and an advanced cooling system (plus 120hz for buth phones and good cameras on the 12 but not on the 12R) for 2400-5800 Yuan (and up to 16GB of ram for 12R and 24GB for 12) is perfect. </p>
<h3>Realme</h3>
<p>Realme provides great value options, like the GT5 Pro, but there are some drawbacks on the GT5 pro, such as the horrible 8MP ultra-wide camera. However, it has the lateset Snapdragon 8 gen 3, up to 16GB RAM and 1TB storage, and has a 144hz LTPO display. The 1TB version only costs 4299 chinese yuan, which is about 900-1000 AUD. So, if you don't care about cameras, the GT5 Pro is a good option.  </p>


<h3>Oppo</h3>
<p>Just buy the Find X7 Ultra. It is the only OPPO-branded phone to have the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, but its main selling point are the cameras. Quad 50-MP camera system plus partership with Hasselblad = the best of the best. Sure, it is not too cheap, but it is at least cheaper than many iPhones and Samsung phones.</p>


<h3>Vivo</h3>

<p>Forget about Vivo. They use MediaTek chips, which suck. Just use a Qualcomm chip and I'll consider Vivo, but they are using MediaTek. 
</p>
<h3>iQOO</h3>
<p>Only get the iQOO 12 Pro. Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, LTPO 144hz, good cameras, great.</p>

<h3>Forget about Apple and Samsung. They are just much too expensive. Really, you should only get apple for the Apple ecosystem, and there are NO reasons for buying Samsung.</h3>

<h2>Tablets</h2>

<p>Only buy iPads. Seriously, don't meddle with Android tablets. And for iPads, we recommend the iPad 10th Gen.</p>

<h2>Laptops</h2>
<p>Lenovo is obviously the best, but if you want to be boring then you can get a HP laptop. If you want to be cheap, go for a DELL chromebook. (Be warned: Chromebooks are terrible). And only get a Mac if you want to do video editing or like the Apple ecosystem. Also, make sure to always get an AMD computer, never intel for windows.</p>


<h2>Kirin 9000S</h2>


<p>The Kirin 9000S is the chip used in the Huawei Mate 60 series. It's not too fast compared to Snapdragon at the moment, but will get a lot faster in the future. If you want to support the Chinese tech industry and deflect the bullying and unfair play by the United States, get a Mate 60/Pro/Pro+.</p>
